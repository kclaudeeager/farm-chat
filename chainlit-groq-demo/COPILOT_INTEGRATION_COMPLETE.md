## 🚀 Live Demo Setup (Complete in 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Access ThingsBoard
```
URL: http://localhost:8080
Username: tenant@thingsboard.org
Password: tenant
```

### Step 2: Import Widget Bundle
1. Navigate to **Widget Library** → **Widget Bundles**
2. Click **"+"** → **"Import widget bundle"**
3. Upload: `./thingsboard-copilot/farm_copilot_bundle.json`

### Step 3: Add to Dashboard
1. Go to **Dashboards** → Create new or edit existing
2. Click **"Edit mode"** (pencil icon)
3. Click **"Add widget"**
4. Select **"Farm Control Copilot"** bundle
5. Choose **"Farm AI Copilot"** widget
6. Configure size (recommended: 8x10 grid units)
7. **Save dashboard**

### Step 4: Test Integration
- The widget will load the Chainlit interface
- AI assistant has access to all MCP farm control tools
- Real-time sensor data flows from ThingsBoard to AI
- Try asking: "What's the current status of our farm sensors?"

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
ThingsBoard Dashboard → Widget JS → Iframe → Chainlit → MCP Server → Farm Tools
                    ↓
              Sensor Data Updates → AI Context → Intelligent Responses
```

### Communication Protocols
- **ThingsBoard ↔ Widget**: JavaScript postMessage API
- **Widget ↔ Chainlit**: Iframe embedding with message passing  
- **Chainlit ↔ AI**: GROQ API with real-time MCP tool integration
- **AI ↔ Farm Systems**: MCP protocol with actual sensor/actuator APIs

### Security Features
- Iframe sandboxing with controlled permissions
- CORS-compliant cross-origin communication  
- No direct network access from widget to external services
- Secure message passing between components

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Real-time Monitoring
**User Action**: "Show me the current temperature and humidity levels"
**AI Response**: Uses MCP tools to query actual sensor data and provides real-time readings

### Scenario 2: Predictive Analysis  
**User Action**: "Based on current conditions, should we water section A?"
**AI Response**: Analyzes sensor data, weather patterns, and irrigation schedules to provide recommendations

### Scenario 3: Issue Detection
**User Action**: "Are there any problems with our sensors?"
**AI Response**: Scans all connected devices, identifies offline sensors or abnormal readings

### Scenario 4: Control Actions
**User Action**: "Turn on the irrigation system for section B"
**AI Response**: Uses MCP actuator tools to send commands and confirms execution

## 🔍 Integration Verification

### ✅ Pre-Demo Checklist
- [ ] ThingsBoard accessible at http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Chainlit demo running at http://localhost:8000  
- [ ] Widget bundle imported successfully
- [ ] Farm AI Copilot widget added to dashboard
- [ ] Widget loads Chainlit interface without errors
- [ ] AI responds to basic queries (test with "Hello")
- [ ] MCP tools are available (test with "What tools do you have access to?")

### 🧪 Live Testing Commands
```bash
# Verify services are running
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | grep -i thingsboard
curl -s http://localhost:8000 | grep -i chainlit

# Check Docker containers (if using Docker Compose)
docker-compose ps

# Test MCP server connectivity
cd /path/to/MCPin10 && python server.py
```

## 🌟 Advanced Features

### Custom Widget Configuration
The widget supports these settings (configurable in ThingsBoard):
- `chainlitUrl`: Target Chainlit service URL
- `title`: Custom widget title  
- `showHeader`: Toggle header visibility
- `autoRefresh`: Automatic reconnection on failures

### Real-time Data Binding
The widget automatically forwards:
- Current sensor readings
- Device status updates  
- Dashboard context (selected time range, active entities)
- User interaction events

### Error Recovery
- Connection loss detection and auto-retry
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting guidance

## 🚢 Production Deployment Notes

### For Live Production Use:
1. **Domain Configuration**: Update URLs from localhost to production domains
2. **SSL/TLS**: Enable HTTPS for all services
3. **Authentication**: Integrate with existing identity providers
4. **CORS Settings**: Configure proper cross-origin policies
5. **Performance**: Consider CDN and caching strategies
6. **Monitoring**: Add health checks and logging

### Scaling Considerations:
- Multiple Chainlit instances behind load balancer
- Horizontal scaling of MCP servers
- Database connection pooling for ThingsBoard
- WebSocket connection management for real-time updates

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Connection Error" in widget**: Verify Chainlit service is running
2. **Blank widget**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors  
3. **AI doesn't see sensor data**: Verify widget datasource configuration
4. **Import fails**: Ensure JSON file is valid and properly formatted

### Debug Mode:
Enable browser developer tools to inspect:
- Network requests between components
- Console logs from widget JavaScript  
- PostMessage communication between iframe and parent
- WebSocket connections to Chainlit backend

## 🎊 Success! 

Your farm AI copilot is now fully integrated with ThingsBoard and ready for live demonstration. The system provides:

- **Seamless AI Integration** within existing IoT dashboards
- **Real-time Data Awareness** for intelligent recommendations  
- **Production-grade Architecture** suitable for actual deployment
- **Extensible Framework** for additional AI capabilities

**Next Steps**: Import the widget bundle, add to dashboard, and start your live demo! 🚀
