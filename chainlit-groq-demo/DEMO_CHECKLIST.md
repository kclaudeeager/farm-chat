## 🎭 Demo Script (3-5 minutes)

### Opening Statement (30 seconds)
> "I've built an AI-powered farm management system that lets farmers control their equipment using natural language. Let me show you how it works."

### Demo Flow

#### 1. **Farm Overview** (30 seconds)
```
👤 User: "Show me all my farms"
```
**Expected Result:** List of farms with basic info
**Key Points:** 
- Real data integration
- Clean, professional interface
- Tool execution visible

#### 2. **Sensor Monitoring** (45 seconds)
```
👤 User: "Check the sensor data for farm 1"
```
**Expected Result:** Current sensor readings
**Key Points:**
- Real-time data access
- Multiple sensor types
- Farm-friendly formatting

#### 3. **Equipment Control** (60 seconds)
```
👤 User: "Open the irrigation valve for field 2"
```
**Expected Result:** Confirmation of valve operation
**Key Points:**
- Actual system control (not just queries)
- Safety considerations
- Clear feedback

#### 4. **Resource Management** (45 seconds)
```
👤 User: "What are my current resource levels?"
```
**Expected Result:** Water/nutrient levels display
**Key Points:**
- Operational insights
- Threshold monitoring
- Decision support

#### 5. **Advanced Automation** (60 seconds)
```
👤 User: "Create an irrigation schedule for field 1 starting at 6 AM for 30 minutes"
```
